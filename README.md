Text Sequence Prediction with LSTM, GRU, and ELECTRA Transformer Models
Project Goal
The overarching aim of this project, as detailed in the Jupyter Notebook "lstm-gru-electra-transformer-models.ipynb," is to delve into text sequence prediction using a blend of diverse neural network architecturesâ€”Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and ELECTRA Transformer models. Utilizing a dataset labeled "reviews.csv," the project focuses on training and evaluating these architectures to understand their performance in real-world text sequence prediction tasks.

Learning Outcomes
Comprehensive Understanding of Neural Network Architectures
Develop a nuanced understanding of LSTM, GRU, and ELECTRA models, their inner workings, and how they are distinct yet complementary in handling sequence data.
Data Wrangling and Preprocessing
Master the art of data manipulation with pandas, as exhibited in the code where the 'reviews.csv' dataset is read and prepared for the machine learning pipeline.
Hands-On Model Building
Implement and train LSTM, GRU, and ELECTRA models from scratch, as illustrated in the notebook.
Utilize TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub for leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.
Model Evaluation and Interpretation
Learn how to evaluate models using various performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score, as outlined in the notebook.
Gain insights into model interpretation techniques to understand why a particular prediction was made.
Real-world Applications and Predictions
Understand how these models can be applied in diverse areas such as sentiment analysis, stock market prediction, and natural language understanding.
Engage in actual text sequence prediction exercises using the trained models, as shown in the notebook's prediction sections.
Comparative Analysis and Model Selection
Become adept at comparing different neural network architectures on the same problem statement.
Make informed decisions on model selection based on trade-offs between accuracy, complexity, and computational resources.
