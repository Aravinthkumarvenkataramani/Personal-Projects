## Introduction

This project aims to explore and compare various neural network architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and ELECTRA Transformer models, for sequence prediction tasks. It uses a dataset containing text reviews to train and evaluate these models.

## Libraries and Tools

The project starts with the importation of various Python libraries essential for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

```python
import string
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import colors
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow_text as text
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```

## Data Preparation

I read a dataset called 'reviews.csv' to start the data preparation process. This dataset contains text reviews which will be used for model training and evaluation.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('reviews.csv')
```

## Model Building

### LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.

### GRU

Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are similar to LSTMs but have fewer parameters and do not have a separate cell state.

### ELECTRA

ELECTRA is a new pretraining approach which trains two transformer models: the generator and the discriminator.

## Prediction

This section focuses on using the trained models for sequence prediction.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive comparison between LSTM, GRU, and ELECTRA Transformer models for sequence prediction tasks.
